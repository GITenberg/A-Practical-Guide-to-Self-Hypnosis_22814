description: All of us like to think that our actions and reactions are a result of
  logical thought processes, but the fact is that suggestion influences our thinking
  a great deal more than logic. Consciously or unconsciously, our feelings about almost
  everything are largely molded by ready-made opinions and attitudes fostered by our
  mass methods of communication. Self-hypnosis is a highly suggestible state wherein
  the individual can direct suggestions to himself. It is a powerful tool in any therapeutic
  process, and highly motivated subjects can parallel the success of hetero-hypnosis
  through their own efforts. Self-hypnosis can be used as a palliative agent and can
  even afford lasting results in many areas of the organism. Self-hypnosis can alleviate
  distressing symptoms, substitute strong responses for weak responses, help overcome
  bad habits, create good habits and help one's power of concentration. The total
  personality is eventually changed to the point where it can function adequately
  in an increasingly difficult environment.
